# UltimateVirtualMaster

UltimateVirtualMaster - UVM for short is an program idea that allows subs to be controlled without their dom present or if they do not have a dom then simulate having one. Nearly everything can be modified with a simple UI and if you wish to have even more control feel free to use the soure code but do not re-distribute it please. 

# Features
_1. Browser/App mode:_
the application comes with 2 UIs, a browser based one and an app based one. If you prefer to make the interface look however you envision then the recommended mode  would be Browser mode. However you can not change the program's behaviour using the browser mode, it is only for interacting from the subs side. You have to use the application to modify the behaviour.
  
_2. Discord integration_:
there's also a discord integration that you can use to provide extra control and closer access. There is a bot that you can add to your server which allows you to do similar actions as in Browser mode just on the go meaning that the fun doesn't end just by leaving the house.
